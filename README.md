This is a game of Simon made using the Pygame library in Python. With each passing turn, one item is added to a pattern. The player's job is to remember what pattern was generated and to input that pattern as it was given. If the player correctly inputs the pattern for that turn, one point is awarded. The goal is to generate the longest pattern the player can remember (length of pattern represented by number of points).

**NOTE:** Must place .exe file in same directory as sound files to run application.
